            <div class="article-image" style="height: 400px; margin-bottom: 30px; background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611224923853-80b023f02d71?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80');"></div>
            
            <p>On 11 October 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans via Truth Social to impose an additional 100% tariff on China, alongside export controls on all critical software.</p>
            
            <p>This tariff increase adds to the existing 30% tariff on Chinese goods, bringing the total to around 130%. Trump earlier wrote about perceived Chinese hostilities regarding Chinese export restrictions on rare earth elements and other key materials. Trump wrote that China is trying to monopolise critical resources and "hold the world captive", calling the move "sinister".</p>
            
            <p>The S&P 500 lost over $2 trillion in market value amid investor concerns about higher operational costs for companies, especially those dependent on imported materials or goods.</p>
            
            <p>Investors anticipate increased costs to weigh on corporate earnings growth. Certain sectors like technology and manufacturing, with high import exposure, are expected to be more vulnerable to the impact of the tariffs.</p>
            
            <p>Economists note that heightened tariffs may slow economic growth by reducing consumer spending due to higher prices.</p>
            
            <p>Investors will be closely monitoring new developments in the coming weeks, given their potential to affect supply chains, profitability, and broader market valuations.</p>
