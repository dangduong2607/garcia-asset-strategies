            <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
            
            <p>On 29 October 2025, Nvidia became the first public company to exceed a market capitalisation of US$5 trillion. The company had earlier crossed US$4 trillion in July 2025, taking only about 79 trading days to gain the additional trillion dollars in market capitalisation.</p>
            
            <p>Nvidia's GPU and AI chips garnered investor confidence as new government contracts, renewed potential for negotiations with China, and enthusiasm over artificial intelligence technology were some of the latest factors pushing up prices.</p>
            
            <p>Amidst excitement over Nvidia price increases, overvaluation concerns remain. Garcia Asset Strategies conducted a comparable analysis with the results as follows:</p>
            
            <h3>NVDA Valuation Summary</h3>
            
            <p>Compared to our peer set, Nvidia trades at a higher valuation than the average and median across all valuation metrics reviewed. While its P/E ratio is above the peer-group average and median, it is slightly below the market-capitalisation-weighted average P/E ratio.</p>
            
            <p>Companies like AMD and Broadcom are also pushing up the industry benchmarks, meaning peer companies outside these three tend to have relatively lower valuations.</p>
            
            <p>Nevertheless, finding companies comparable to Nvidia within its industry can be challenging due to the company significantly exceeding other semiconductor companies' market capitalisations.</p>
            
            <p>Market participants are observing NVIDIA's growth and valuation as the company approaches its quarterly earnings on 19 November.</p>
